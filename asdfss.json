This rebate is a great way for homeowners in Illinois to get solar panels at an affordable price while also being able to take advantage of the benefits that come with owning solar panels. One of these benefits is not having to worry about high electricity bills anymore, because once you purchase and install solar panels on your property, you will cut down on how much money you spend each month on energy costs.\n\nAlthough most people think that Chicagoland doesn't have enough sun, there is more than enough sun in the summer to make up for the very dark winters. In addition, the UV rays that come through the clouds are also used by solar panels to generate energy.\n\nThis means that even if you live in one of the coldest places in Illinois, solar panels can still save you a lot of money on your electricity bills.\n\nFor more information about installing solar panels on your property to reduce costs while also lowering our dependence on traditional energy sources like coal and natural gas, head over to our website!\n\n#illinoissolar #solarrebate #solarenergy ",

Even places with relatively low solar resources, such as the Pacific Northwest and Alaska, can experience cost savings, and have similar solar resources to countries that have widely developed solar PV, like Germany.\n\nEnvironmental: Each kilowatt-hour (kWh) of solar that is generated will substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions like CO2, as well as other dangerous pollutants such as sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter.\u00a0Solar also reduces water consumption and withdrawal.\n\n#benefitsofsolar #gosolar #gogreen #solarenergy ",

So, we are building the necessary products, tooling, and services to help independent workers thrive.\n\nOur first product is Radius (https://radius.space). Radius is a decentralized network that connects independent workers and teams to the best projects in web3.

The court granted BWB&O\u2019s Motion for Terminating Sanctions and Plaintiff\u2019s Complaint was dismissed with prejudice.\n \nPlaintiff filed a complaint alleging she sustained multiple injuries after a slip and fall in a hotel. Plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleged that BWB&O\u2019s client was negligent, careless, and reckless in the ownership, care, control, and maintenance of the premises. BWB&O aggressively defended its client and filed several motions, arguing Plaintiff\u2019s conduct abused the discovery process. The Court sided with BWB&O and granted its Motion for Terminating Sanctions, and the lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice.\n\nGreat work and congratulations again to Eileen and Kelsey!",

Good ideas are fleshed out, and a plan for achieving a visual representation of the idea is set early in the creative process.

This is just the beginning of a subdivision drainage improvement project that is sure to make a long-term impact, after 33 structures were flooded during Hurricane Harvey.\n\nNew drainage pipes, reconstruction of driveways and street sections, the adjustment of waterlines and sanitary sewer lines, as well as a detention pond are in the plans to bring this vision to life. None of this would be possible without the hard work and partnerships of all involved. We are happy to be a part in making a difference.",

Understanding these two concepts' differences is crucial to creating a more just and equitable world, particularly in industries like tech, where women are underrepresented and face unique challenges.\n\nLet's reflect on the importance of equity in achieving gender equality. It's not enough to strive for equality alone. By promoting equity and diversity in the tech industry and beyond, we can create a more inclusive world where everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed.\n\n#IWD2023 #EmbraceEquity #TechEmpowersWomen",

Founded in Solingen, Germany, known for centuries as the \"City of Blades\", the brand is owned by the seventh generation of the W\u00dcSTHOF family. In their state-of-the-art manufacturing facility, the company creates a variety of knife collections and cooking utensils. W\u00dcSTHOF is appreciated for its art of crafting; it takes over forty manufacturing steps to make a W\u00dcSTHOF knife, with many made by hand, using traditional skills and techniques. Forged knives from the famous CLASSIC Collection have become the symbol of W\u00dcSTHOF and are a lifelong companion for chefs all over the world. With over 500 employees in North America and Europe, the brand is available at leading culinary retailers worldwide.\n\nThroughout recent years, consumers rediscovered that healthy eating is the foundation of a healthy body and mind. Along with the pleasure of preparing and enjoying homemade meals together with family and friends, consumers recognize that a healthy planet is an essential element of this lifestyle. At a time where disposable products cloud the future of our planet, W\u00dcSTHOF is loved for its commitment to responsibly crafting premium products that last a lifetime and are often handed down to the next generation. This appreciation and emotional connection recently led the company to launch its direct-to-consumer business. As W\u00dcSTHOF builds their bond with the consumer, they will take this relationship further by creating and sharing digital content and tangible experiences.\n\nW\u00dcSTHOF, what brings us together every day is the joy of a tasty and healthy meal.",

After that, screening should happen every 10 years.\n\u2022\tPeople may need to be screened before age 45 or more frequently than others if they have conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis, or a personal or family history of colorectal cancer. \n\u2022\tIt\u2019s important to speak with your healthcare provider about when to begin screening and how often to get tested.\n\u2022\tKinney Drugs does carry what\u2019s called a FIT test or (fecal immunochemical test) which detects blood in the stool that you may not be able to see with the naked eye. It\u2019s not a substitute for a colonoscopy, but it\u2019s easy, inexpensive, and can be done right at home. No prescription needed.\n\u2022\tAlso, the Colorectal Cancer Alliance offers a free quiz to help you answer the question: \"Do I need to get screened for colorectal cancer?\" at: https://lnkd.in/etuDhWqQ.",

D\u00e9couvrons ici le parcours de la DG des Jardins de Renoir, Mme Lyne Grenier, ainsi que les facettes de son quotidien. Toute jeune, Lyne est plong\u00e9e dans l\u2019univers de l\u2019immobilier et de la construction, car son p\u00e8re y oeuvre. Elle \u00e9tait loin de se douter que les notions apprises alors lui seraient d\u2019une grande aide un jour! Mais Lyne a la fibre entrepreneurial et elle s\u2019int\u00e9resse \u00e0 tout ce qui touche l\u2019administration et la gestion. Alors qu\u2019elle compl\u00e8te sa formation au coll\u00e8ge Montmorency, elle se d\u00e9couvre une passion pour tout ce qui touche aux ressources humaines.\n\u00a0\nLyne est une jeune femme p\u00e9tillante et ambitieuse. Sans exp\u00e9rience en restauration, elle commence \u00e0 travailler dans la cuisine d\u2019une cha\u00eene de restaurants connue. Ses qualit\u00e9s de leader sont remarqu\u00e9s ce qui lui permet de gravir les \u00e9chelons jusqu\u2019au poste de g\u00e9rante adjointe principale de la succursale. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, les r\u00e9seaux de recherche d\u2019emploi d\u00e9butent et Lyne d\u00e9cide de se cr\u00e9er un profil sur \u00ab\u00a0juste pour le fun\u00a0\u00bb. Elle veut comprendre comment cette technologie fonctionne alors qu\u2019elle compl\u00e8te un certificat en administration et travaille toujours en restauration. \u00c0 sa grande surprise, elle re\u00e7oit un appel des Jardins de Renoir. Un poste de ma\u00eetre d\u2019h\u00f4tel est vacant. Elle se pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue et malgr\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne connaisse pas du tout l\u2019industrie des r\u00e9sidences, elle obtient le poste. Nous sommes en 2003 et Lyne est\njeune maman. La r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et les horaires de la r\u00e9sidence r\u00e9pondent \u00e0 ses besoins. Elle accepte donc ce nouveau d\u00e9fi qui allait la conduire jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale quelques ann\u00e9es plus\ntard.\n\u00a0\nLyne est pers\u00e9v\u00e9rante et \u00e0 chaque fois qu\u2019une opportunit\u00e9 s\u2019offre \u00e0 elle, elle la saisie. C\u2019est ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 peine quelques mois apr\u00e8s son embauche comme ma\u00eetre d\u2019h\u00f4tel, elle devient adjointe \u00e0 la direction puis directrice des RH. Tout est \u00e0 faire. Le d\u00e9fi est de taille et Lyne le rel\u00e8ve avec brio! Cogir construit un agrandissement qui portera le nombre d\u2019appartements \u00e0 740 et Lyne est nomm\u00e9e DG adjointe au c\u00f4t\u00e9 du DG Philippe Benoit. En janvier 2020, Philippe accepte un poste de DG dans une autre r\u00e9sidence Cogir. La porte est ouverte pour Lyne qui accepte le r\u00f4le de DG \u00e0 quelques semaines de ce qui\nallait \u00eatre une p\u00e9riode tr\u00e8s tumultueuse en RPA. \u00ab\u00a0J\u2019ai d\u00e9but\u00e9 mon nouveau poste au meilleur moment car peu importe le nombre d\u2019ann\u00e9es d\u2019exp\u00e9rience qu\u2019un DG pouvait avoir, nous devions tout r\u00e9apprendre en raison de la pand\u00e9mie\u00a0\u00bb partage-t\u2018elle en riant.\n\u00a0\n\u00ab\u00a0J\u2019adore mon poste. C\u2019est un milieu stimulant et tr\u00e8s humain o\u00f9 l\u2019on retrouve un bel \u00e9quilibre entre la gestion et la chaleur des contacts\nhumains avec les r\u00e9sidents, leur famille et les membres de l\u2019\u00e9quipe.\nChaque journ\u00e9e est diff\u00e9rente et l\u2019on touche \u00e0 plusieurs sph\u00e8res d\u2019activit\u00e9s ce qui rend le quotidien tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressant. Les\nr\u00e9sidents sont des gens extraordinaires. Les c\u00f4toyer est un privil\u00e8ge tr\u00e8s enrichissant\u00a0\u00bb conclut-elle. ",
