    "description": "We\u2019re a team of scientists, engineers, machine learning experts and more, working together to advance the state of the art in artificial intelligence. We use our technologies for widespread public benefit and scientific discovery, and collaborate with others on critical challenges, ensuring safety and ethics are the highest priority.\n\nOur long term aim is to solve intelligence, developing more general and capable problem-solving systems, known as artificial general intelligence (AGI). \n\nGuided by safety and ethics, this invention could help society find answers to some of the world\u2019s most pressing and fundamental scientific challenges.\n \nWe have a track record of breakthroughs in fundamental AI research, published in journals like Nature, Science, and more.Our programs have learned to diagnose eye diseases as effectively as the world\u2019s top doctors, to save 30% of the energy used to keep data centres cool, and to predict the complex 3D shapes of proteins - which could one day transform how drugs are invented.",
